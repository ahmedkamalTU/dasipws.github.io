title: "Orbiting the Edge and Stars: Bridging the gap between Space Avionics and Edge Computing, challenges and space mission's needs"
abstract: The keynote will bring the space mission processing challenges and opportunities where high-performance computing and architectural designs are pivotal role. The presentation bridges the gap between space avionics and edge computing realities, illustrating how the challenges faced in space are relevant and interconnected with the challenges encountered for other industries edge computing. Space missions are strongly based in remote processing capabilities in autonomous manner. Communications to ground may be costive, not continuous, limited in bandwidth or with big latencies for real-time actuation needs. Earth Observation and space-based sensors are generating and consuming bigger amount of data and edge computing facilitates communication reduction and real-time executions. Exploration missions and landing operations in other solar system celestial bodies autonomously may impose high-performance solution challenges into avionics electronics that must be reliant and enduring harsh environmental conditions. Fault Tolerant HW/SW architectures and technology robust against cosmic radiation, extreme temperature gradients and mechanical vibrations may limit performance capabilities. Last but not least, machine learning applications are entering more and more in the mission's algorithms, including computing challenges to get the functional benefits desired. Continual learning possibilitites will deal with uncertainties in the explored scenario but also expose avionics towards architectural challenges. These topics will be presented and discussed including examples and roadmaps for key technology for the near future in space.
